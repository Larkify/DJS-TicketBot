    A Discord.JS Bot for handling tickets in your server.
    <br />
    <br />
  </p>
</p>

## Information
So I made this simple and quite incomplete ticket bot, there are a lot of rough patches and it's best you have a basic understanding of navigating through a JavaScript file so you can make it work for you. If you have any issues, join my discord server and I'll see if I can help. I won't be providing loads of support for this though, as it was just a bot for another server and I thought I'd share it with you on GitHub just incase you want to use some of the code in it.

## Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org/)

## Installation & Configuration

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/larkify/djs-censorbot.git

# Enter into the directory
cd djs-censorbot/

# Install the dependencies
npm install
npm install discord.js
npm install moment
npm install path
npm install fs

// And if you still have issues, join the Discord. //
```
After cloning the project and installing all dependencies, you need to fill out the `config.js` file.

## Starting the Bot

```bash
node index.js
```
